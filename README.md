# Hello-World
## About me
**My name is Quinn Geiger, and I am a third year Accounting & Business Analytics and Informations student at the University of Iowa.**

_I decided to major in Business Analytics and Information Systems due to the enjoyment of the other classes I have taken._

However, I am figuring out how I have <sub>a lot</sub> to learn still.

**_I am excited for what's to come and for all of the new things I will learn._**
